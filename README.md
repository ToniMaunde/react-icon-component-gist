# React SVG Icon Component
I decide to port my current SVG Icon Component strategy that I have been using on my Vue.js projects after a tweet I saw.

[Link for the tweet](https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1382838799420514317?s=20)

## Disclaimer
I did not come up with the original idea and unfortunately I can't find the original medium post with this strategy using Vue.js. If you know the author of said post, let me know so I can properly credit him.

## Prerequisites
Have Node.js version >= 14 installed on your machine

## Installing
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ToniMaunde/react-svg-component.git
```

Then navigate inside the folder
```
cd react-svg-component
```

Install the dependencies with
```
npm install
```

After that is done, just run
```
npm run dev
```

## Built with
I used [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) by Evan you to quickly scaffold this "project".

## Contributing
I doubt this is going to get any traction or become anything popular, but if you want to contribute in any way, feel free. I would be glad to gain some OSS experience.

## Authors
Myself, inspired by the aforementioned tweet and medium post.
